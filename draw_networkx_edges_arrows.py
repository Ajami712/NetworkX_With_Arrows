Nassim's notes:
This code is mostly unchanged from its source.
All credit is due to the team at http://networkx.github.io/ who
certainly know more about coding than I do.

All major changes that I've made will be prefaced with
snippets of comments much like this one. All work was
done in Python 2.7.6.

I wrote this because I really wanted arrowheads in my network.
My changes to the function are a work in progress, but currently
here is what you can do:

- Have triangular arrows drawn along edges in your directed graph.

- Opt for traditional square boxes drawn along edges, in case you
want to differentiate between inhibition and activation.

- Modulate the width of the arrows and their position along the edge.
(This functionality has not been made into parameter inputs yet, but
they are currently present in the function as pre-set constants.)

I envision making those pre-set constants into actual parameters
sometime in the future. I am also interested in modifying the
actual edge-drawing functionality as well. At present, the
function does not seem capable of drawing loops (edges that start
and end at the same vertex). This seems fixable with some
shape manipulation via matplotlib.

    """Draw the edges of the graph G.

    This draws only the edges of the graph G.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
       A networkx graph

    pos : dictionary
       A dictionary with nodes as keys and positions as values.
       Positions should be sequences of length 2.

    edgelist : collection of edge tuples
       Draw only specified edges(default=G.edges())

    width : float
       Line width of edges (default =1.0)

    edge_color : color string, or array of floats
       Edge color. Can be a single color format string (default='r'),
       or a sequence of colors with the same length as edgelist.
       If numeric values are specified they will be mapped to
       colors using the edge_cmap and edge_vmin,edge_vmax parameters.

    style : string
       Edge line style (default='solid') (solid|dashed|dotted,dashdot)

    alpha : float
       The edge transparency (default=1.0)

    edge_ cmap : Matplotlib colormap
       Colormap for mapping intensities of edges (default=None)

    edge_vmin,edge_vmax : floats
       Minimum and maximum for edge colormap scaling (default=None)

    ax : Matplotlib Axes object, optional
       Draw the graph in the specified Matplotlib axes.

    arrows : bool, optional (default=True)
       For directed graphs, if True draw arrowheads.

    arrowheads : bool, optional (default=True)
       For directed graphs, if True draw a traditional triangular arrowhead.
       If false, draw the old box-like structure instead.

    label : [None| string]
       Label for legend

    Returns
    -------
    matplotlib.collection.LineCollection
        `LineCollection` of the edges

    Notes
    -----
    For directed graphs, "arrows" (actually just thicker stubs) are drawn
    at the head end.  Arrows can be turned off with keyword arrows=False.
    Yes, it is ugly but drawing proper arrows with Matplotlib this
    way is tricky.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G=nx.dodecahedral_graph()
    >>> edges=nx.draw_networkx_edges(G,pos=nx.spring_layout(G))
